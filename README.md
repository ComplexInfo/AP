# Dynamics of Affective Polarization
## This code supplements our paper titled "Dynamics of Affective Polarization: From Consensus to Partisan Divides"

 The trajectories of the differential equation that represents the model dynamics of the proposed model can simulated using the directory named "Theoretical Results".
 Simulation of the model on two real-world networks (Facebook and Brightkite) are given in the diretory named "Results with Real Networks".
